# Boilerplate
This gives a very basic boilerplate for a react app where webpack is bundling up all files and is been served into the html file through the script tag

# To use
<li>Clone the repo</li>
<li>Run: npm install</li>
<li>Run: webpack -w</li>
<li>Run: node server.js</li>
<li>Open: "localhost:8000" in the browser</li>
<li>Make the appropriate changes to reflect what your new project</li>
